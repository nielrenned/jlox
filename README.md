# Crafting an Interpreter

This repository is the code for my follow-along of [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), Part 1. At this point it should be a fully-functional version of the interpreter.

The whole experience was really fun and I learned a ton about how compilers/interpreters work and think. This ended up making me a better programmer as a byproduct, since I could better read/understand the compiler errors, and avoid common mistakes before they happened.

I do plan to do Part 2 at some point, but that'll have to be later.
